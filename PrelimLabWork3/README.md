Tasked to develop two versions of the same program, one with Java and the other with JavaScript. The program computes the required prelim exam scores to achieve a passing and excellent grade for the prelim period.

The Prelim Grade is computed using the following breakdown:
30% – Prelim Exam
70% – Class Standing

Class Standing Composition (70%)
The Class Standing consists of:
40% – Attendance
60% – Average of Lab Works

Lab Works included:
Lab Work 1
Lab Work 2
Lab Work 3

Target Grades for Prelim Exam

Passing Grade: 75
Excellent Grade: 100

The programs must show the needed required prelim exam score to reach each target if achievable.

Both Java and JavaScript must follow the required computations and logic as instructed.
